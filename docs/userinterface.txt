User Interface

Arguments:

Arguments(0) = None
Passing 0 arguments will prompt the program to print the full file list.
Program will then exit

Arguments(1) = [File_Number]:Int
If a file number is passed the file number is searched and the contents of the file are returned using the default cipher key
A valid file number must be passed otherwise an error will be thrown
Program will then exit

Arguments(2) = [File_Number]:Int [Cipher]:Cipher
If a file number and cipher are passed the file number is searched and the contents are returned using the provided cipher key
A valid file number must be passed otherwise an error will be thrown
A valid Cipher must be passed otherwise an error will be thrown
Program will then exit

The command line user interface is needed for making our program callable
from the command line with correct number and quality of parameters
pseudocode
arg_len = length of args
switch case with arg_len
0:  call method to print files
1:  check for proper input
    call method to print file content
2:  check for proper input
    call method to print deciphered file content

Test: 0 arguments get passed
Check: Does the program print out the full file list and swiftly exit

Test: 1 valid argument gets passed
Check: Does the program print out the file using the default cipher and swiftly exit

Test: 1 invalid (integer) argument gets passed
Check: Does the program throw an error stating there is no such file number and swiftly exit

Test: 1 invalid (Non-integer) argument gets passed
Check: Does the program throw an error stating that it requires an integer argument and swiftly exit

Test: 2 valid arguments get passed
Check: Does the program print the requested file using the requested cipher and swiftly exit

Test: 1 invalid (integer) argument gets passed and 1 valid cipher gets passed
Check: Does the program throw an error stating there is no such file number and swiftly exit

Test: 1 invalid (Non-integer) argument gets passed and 1 valid cipher gets passed
Check: Does the program throw an error stating that it requires an integer argument and swiftly exit

Test: 1 valid int argument gets passed and 1 invalid (Non-cipher) gets passed
Check: Does the program throw an error stating that it requires a cipher argument to be passed and swiftly exit

Test: More than 2 arguments are passed
Check: Does the program throw an error stating that too many arguments were provided
